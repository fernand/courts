OPINION

Plaintiff Nelson’s Cabinetry, Inc., a Virginia corporation, filed an
employment-based visa petition on behalf of Carlos Eduardo Pimentel, an employee of Nelson’s
Cabinetry and a Brazilian national. The consular officer ultimately denied Mr. Pimentel’s visa
application. Mr. Pimentel, members of his family, Karen Gasparetto Pimentel and Lucas
Gasparetto Pimentel, and Nelson’s Cabinetry have brought this action against U.S. Secretary of
State Antony Blinken, U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, and U.S. Consul General, Rio
De Janeiro, Jacqueline Ward, challenging the denial. Pending before the Court is defendants’
motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon careful consideration of the parties’ written submissions and the

relevant authorities, the Court grants defendants’ motion and dismisses the complaint.!

I The Court has reviewed the following papers in connection with this matter:
Plaintiffs’ Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Review of Agency Action Under
the Administrative Procedure Act (“Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 1]; Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss
I. BACKGROUND
A. Statutory Background
The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., sets out
the process by which noncitizens apply for visas to enter the United States. The particular visa
category at issue in this case is an EB-3 visa, which is an employment-based visa for “[s]killed

workers, professionals, and other workers.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(3); accord Cheng v.

Blinken, Civil Action No. 23-02602 (JDB), 2024 WL 4345831, at *1 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024).

To initiate the process for obtaining an EB-3 visa, a prospective U.S. employer or
the noncitizen visa applicant must first file a Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Work,
which the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) uses to confirm that
the noncitizen applicant is eligible for the intended visa category. See 8 U.S.C.
§§ 1154(a)(1)(B), (F); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 204.5(a), (c). USCIS investigates the petition and
will approve the petition if the applicant demonstrates eligibility. See 8 U.S.C. § 1154(b); 8
C.F.R. § 204.5(g)-(n). If the petition is approved, the applicant is placed in a queue to submit a
visa application, which is subject to certain numerical limitations prescribed by the INA for the
number of employment-based visas made available each year. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1 151(d), 1152,
1153(b).

If the applicant is permitted to submit a visa application, and if the applicant is
located outside of the United States, USCIS sends the approved Form I-140 to the State
Department’s National Visa Center (“NVC”) for pre-processing. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(n)(1).

The NVC then contacts the applicant to request certain documentation and an application fee.

(“Mem.”) [Dkt. No. 11]; Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss (“Opp.”) [Dkt. No. 14]; and Defendants’ Reply to Pls. Opp. (“Reply”) [Dkt. No. 17].

2
See 22 C.F.R. §§ 42.63(a)(1), (c), 42.71(b). Once an applicant has completed these
requirements, the NVC will schedule an interview with a consular officer at the U.S. Consulate
in the applicant’s home country. See 22 C.F.R. § 42.62. During the interview, the applicant
makes and executes a visa application. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(1), 1202(a)-(b); 22 C.F.R.

§§ 42.61, 42.62. The applicant bears the burden of showing that he or she is eligible to receive a
visa. See 8 U.S.C. § 1361. After the visa application is executed, the consular officer is required
to either issue a visa or refuse the visa application. See 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g); 22 C.F.R. § 42.81(a).
In the event that the consular officer refuses the visa application, the officer is required to
provide the applicant “with a timely written notice” that “states the determination” and “lists the
specific provision or provisions of law under which the alien is inadmissible.” 8 U.S.C.

§ 1182(b)(1).

B. Factual and Procedural Background
Mr. Pimentel, his wife, Karen Gasparetto Pimentel, and their child, Lucas
Gasparetto Pimentel, entered the United States in July 2015 on B-2 tourist visas. Compl. J 52.
On January 6, 2016, several weeks before their tourist visas were set to expire on January 20,
2016, Mrs. Gasparetto filed an I-539 Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, which

USCIS approved on February 29, 2016. Id. 99] 52-54.7

2 Plaintiffs refer to Karen Gasparetto Pimentel as Mrs. Gasparetto. The Court will
therefore refer to her as the same.

While not relevant to the instant action, an I-539 Application to Extend/Change
Nonimmigrant Status allows, inter alia, “[c]ertain nonimmigrants” to extend their stay or change
their nonimmigrant status. See 1-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status,
USCIS, at https://www.uscis.gov/i-539 (last visited on October 29, 2024).

3
On July 25, 2018, Nelson’s Cabinetry filed a Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for
Alien Work, on behalf of Mr. Pimentel. Compl. 456. USCIS approved the petition on
August 30, 2018, and transferred the visa case to NVC sometime in September 2018. Id.
9] 56-57. Mr. Pimentel and his family submitted the required information and NVC transferred
the visa application to the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Id. fj 58-593

On February 8, 2019, Mr. Pimentel and his family attended their interviews with
the consular officer in Rio de Janeiro. Compl. 460. The consular officer did not approve the
visa application and notified the family that additional processing was required. Id. 4 61.
Several months later, and without prior notification, Mr. Pimentel became aware that his visa
application had been denied after checking “the NVC case status website.” Id. 62. On May 10,
2019, Mr. Pimentel, through counsel, sent an email to the U.S. Consulate inquiring into the
reasons for the denial. Id. The U.S. Consulate responded several days later and attached a copy
of Mr. Pimentel’s “denial notice.” Id. { 63.

The denial notice listed two grounds for Mr. Pimentel’s ineligibility to receive the
EB-3 visa. Compl. | 64. First, Mr. Pimentel was found ineligible under 8 U.S.C.
§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), which provides that “[a]ny alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a
material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other

documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this chapter

: The complaint states that Mrs. Gasparetto and Lucas Gasparetto Pimentel
submitted documentation and applications along with Mr. Pimentel. See, e.g., Compl. J 61
(stating that the U.S. Consulate denied “Mr. Pimentel and his derivatives’ immigration
applications”). Defendants point out that under 8 U.S.C. § 1153(d), “[a] spouse or child .. . [is]
entitled to the same status” as the primary applicant. See Mem. at 4 n.3. Plaintiffs do not
provide a reason why the Court should consider each application separately. The Court therefore
focuses its analysis on the denial of Mr. Pimentel’s visa application.

is inadmissible.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i); Compl. 64. Second, Mr. Pimentel was found
ineligible under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(G)(D, which provides that:

[a]ny alien who .. . was unlawfully present in the United States for

a period of more than 180 days but less than 1 year, voluntarily

departed the United States (whether or not pursuant to section

1254a(e)2 of this title) prior to the commencement of proceedings

under section 1225(b)(1) of this title or section 1229a of this title,

and again seeks admission within 3 years of the date of such alien’s

departure or removal . . . is inadmissible.

8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i); see Compl. § 64. The information provided by the U.S. Consulate
“did not include any factual basis or specific reasons why Mr. Pimentel was deemed
inadmissible under [the] two sections of [the] INA.” Id. 4 65.

On May 14, 2019, Mr. Pimentel, through counsel, emailed the U.S. Consulate
requesting further information about the factual bases supporting the decision to deny his visa
application. Compl. 66. The U.S. Consulate responded that “during the interview, beneficiary
engaged in unauthorized employment after entering the U.S. for a temporary visit.” Id. J 67.
Mr. Pimentel’s counsel again emailed the U.S. Consulate requesting information and several
days later it “provided the factual basis for the refusal.” Id. {{] 68-69.

Regarding the first ground — related to misrepresentations in Mr. Pimentel’s visa
application — the consular officer found that Mr. Pimentel had impermissibly engaged in work as
a cabinet installer for a carpentry firm and therefore had made a material misrepresentation in his
visa application by failing to disclose this information. Compl. {J 70, 76. The consular officer
further noted that despite being given the opportunity, Mr. Pimentel was “unable to rebut this
finding.” Id. { 70.

With respect to the second ground — related to unlawful presence in the United

States — the consular officer found that Mr. Pimentel had accrued a total of 197 days in which he
was unlawfully present in the United States. Compl. 74. There were two particular periods the
consular officer used to calculate the total number of days. First, Mr. Pimentel had accrued 35
days of unlawful presence during the period from January 24, 2016, when his tourist visa
expired, to February 29, 2016, when his immigration status was changed as a result of Mrs.
Gasparetto’s approved I-539 Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. Id. <9 71-72.
Second, Mr. Pimentel accrued 162 days of unlawful presence during the period in which he
engaged in unlawful work — from August 9, 2018, to January 17, 2019. Id. | 73.

Mr. Pimentel’s previous counsel responded to the U.S. Consulate’s email,
disputing the consular officer’s reasoning. As to the first ground — related to material
misrepresentations — Mr. Pimentel’s previous counsel argued that the consular officer
impermissibly applied the “90-day misrepresentation rule,” which was not effective at the time
of Mr. Pimentel’s alleged violation. Compl. f{] 77-78; see id. 96-103. Previous counsel also
argued that Mr. Pimentel did not materially misrepresent information in his application because
he had disclosed his work in the United States. Id. ] 76; see id. (J 109-17. As for the second

ground — related to Mr. Pimentel’s accrual of unlawfully present days — previous counsel argued

4 The complaint and the parties’ written submissions do not discuss the “90-day
rule” to any significant extent. For the sake of completeness, however, it appears that plaintiffs’
previous counsel was referencing 9 Foreign Affairs Manual § 302.9-4(B)(3)(g)(2), which
provides that a visa application may be denied where “an individual engages in conduct
inconsistent with their nonimmigrant status within 90 days of visa application or admission to the
United States.” See Compl. § 70 (alleging that consular officer found that “within 90 days of his
arrival,” Mr. Pimentel “engag[ed] in activities that are inconsistent with the B-1/B-2 non-
immigrant status”). Given the lack of discussion in the parties’ submissions, the multiple
grounds provided by the consular officer for denying Mr. Pimentel a visa, and the limited
judicial review of the consular officer’s decision — discussed more below — the Court need not
determine whether the “90-day rule” was violated or applicable to Mr. Pimentel’s application.
See Calvary Albuquerque, Inc. v. Blinken, 720 F. Supp. 3d 1138, 1159 n.11 (D.N.M. 2024)
(finding the application of the “90-day rule” “irrelevant” given multiple grounds for the denial of
a visa).

that the consular officer had impermissibly relied on a “new ‘unlawful presence’ policy” in
calculating the total number of days Mr. Pimentel had been unlawfully present. Compl. {| 79; see
id. Ff 120-30. Specifically, previous counsel highlighted a district court decision that had
enjoined the Department of State from “apply[ing] the new ‘unlawful presence’ policy regarding
when a F, M, J applicant is found to have been accruing unlawful presence.” Id. | 79; see

Guilford Coll. v. McAleenan, 389 F. Supp. 3d 377, 384 (M.D.N.C. 2019). In other words, the

suspension of this new policy meant that Mr. Pimentel had not accrued more than 180 days of
unlawful presence — and was thus not inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. § ! 182(a)(9)(B)(i) — because
the consular officer should not count the 35 days between the expiration of his tourist visa and
USCIS’s approval of the I-539 Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status towards the
total amount of days unlawfully present. See id. { 127.°

On June 18, 2019, the U.S. Consulate responded that it had reviewed the

arguments and concluded that Mr. Pimentel remained ineligible for the same reasons it had

5 Similar to the “90-day rule,” see supra note 4, a discussion of the arguments
raised by Mr. Pimentel’s previous counsel is absent from the parties’ written submissions in
connection with the instant motion. Plaintiffs reference a case in the complaint related to the
“new ‘unlawful presence’ policy.” See Compl. { 124. In that case, Guilford Coll. v.
McAleenan, 389 F. Supp. 3d 377, 384 (M.D.N.C. 2019), the court enjoined a USCIS rule change
related to the method of calculating days for which “F, J, and M nonimmigrant visa holders”
were considered unlawfully present in the United States. In particular, the change would have
“start[ed] the unlawful presence clock” on the day “on which the underlying facts that gave rise
to the status violation occurred,” rather than “on the date that an individual on an F, J, or M visa
is adjudicated as being out-of-status.” Guilford Coll. v. McAleenan, 389 F. Supp. 3d at 384-85.

While not relevant to the Court’s analysis, it is unclear how this rule change
applies to Mr. Pimentel since the complaint makes clear that he was not an “F, J, and M
nonimmigrant visa holder[]” during the 35-day period at issue. See Compl. {/ 72. Specifically,
Mr. Pimentel’s tourist visa expired on January 20, 2016, and his F-2 visa — which he obtained
following Mrs. Gasparetto’s approved I-539 Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant
Status — was approved on February 29, 2016. Compl. ff] 52-54. The 35 days Mr. Pimentel
accrued therefore were accrued prior to the approval of his F-2 visa.

fi
already articulated. Compl. § 81. In response to previous counsel’s argument that Mr. Pimentel
was nonetheless entitled to a waiver of ineligibility, the U.S. Consulate indicated that the “law
does not provide a waiver of these ineligibilities for immigrant visa applicants in the EW3 visa
category so no further action on your client’s case is possible.” Id. ¢ 82. Mr. Pimentel requested

reconsideration, which was denied by the U.S. Consulate. Id. ¥ 84.

I]. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A. Motions to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, possessing only those powers

authorized by the Constitution and an act of Congress. See, e.g., Janko v. Gates, 741 F.3d 136,

139 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Abulhawa v. U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, 239 F. Supp. 3d 24, 30

(D.D.C. 2017). Lack of subject matter jurisdiction is fatal to a court’s authority to hear a case.
See FED. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). The plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing that the Court has

jurisdiction. See Khadr v. United States, 529 F.3d 1112, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2008); Walen v. United

States, 246 F. Supp. 3d 449, 452 (D.D.C. 2017). In determining whether to grant a motion to
dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Court must construe the complaint in plaintiffs’ favor and treat all well-pleaded

factual allegations as true. See Attias v. CareFirst, Inc., 865 F.3d 620, 627 (D.C. Cir. 2017).

Although the Court must grant plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences, it “need not
accept factual inferences drawn by plaintiffs if those inferences are not supported by facts

alleged in the complaint,” and the Court need not accept plaintiffs’ legal conclusions. Disner v.

United States, 888 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting Speelman v. United States, 461 F.

Supp. 2d 71, 73 (D.D.C. 2006)). In determining whether a plaintiff has established jurisdiction,
the Court may consider materials beyond the pleadings where appropriate. See Cumis Ins.

Soc’y. Inc. v. Clark, 318 F. Supp. 3d 199, 207 (D.D.C. 2018).

B. Motions to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
To withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6),

plaintiffs must plead facts'that “give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the

grounds upon which it rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (alteration
in original). Although “detailed factual allegations” are not necessary to withstand a
Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted

as true, ‘to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,

678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570); see Spence v. U.S. Dep’t

of Veterans Affs., 109 F.4th 531, 539 (D.C. Cir. 2024). And “[a] claim has facial plausibility

when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference

that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” In re Interbank Funding Corp. Sec.

Litig., 629 F.3d 213, 218 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678).

In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court “must accept the
plaintiff's factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.”

Sanchez v. Off. of State Superintendent of Educ., 45 F.4th 388, 395 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see

Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. The Court considers the complaint in its entirety, see Tellabs,

Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007), and construes it liberally,

granting plaintiffs “the benefit of all inferences that can [reasonably] be derived from the facts

alleged.” See Sickle v. Torres Advanced Enter. Sols., LLC., 884 F.3d 338, 345 (D.C. Cir. 2018)
(alteration in original). The Court, however, need not accept all inferences drawn by the plaintiff

“if such inferences are unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint.” Nurriddin v.
Bolden, 818 F.3d 751, 756 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Nor is the Court “bound to accept as true a legal

conclusion couched as a factual allegation.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; see also Kaempa

v. Myers, 367 F.3d 958, 963 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“Nor must we accept as true the complaint's

factual allegations insofar as they contradict exhibits or matters subject to judicial notice.”).

II. DISCUSSION

The complaint states two causes of action. The first is that the consular officer’s
decision to deny Mr. Pimentel’s visa was “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the
Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). See Compl. { 99-133. The second is that the consular
officer’s decision violated plaintiffs’ due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. See id.
qf 134-36.

Defendants argue that the complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.
Defendants first argue that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue Attorney General Merrick Garland
and Secretary of State Antony Blinken because neither defendant had a role in the adjudication
of Mr. Pimentel’s visa application and because both defendants lack the authority to re-open and
re-adjudicate the application. See Mem. at 6-8. As to the remaining defendant — Jacqueline
Ward, U.S. Consul General, Rio De Janeiro — defendants argue that the consular
nonreviewability doctrine bars judicial review of the consular officer’s decision. See id. at 8-17.

The Court begins by addressing the claims as they relate to Attorney General
Merrick Garland and Secretary of State Antony Blinken and concludes by discussing the

consular nonreviewability doctrine.

10
A. The Attorney General is Not a Proper Defendant
“Article III of the Constitution confines the jurisdiction of federal courts to

‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies.’” FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 378 (2024).

To establish standing, “a plaintiff must demonstrate (i) that she has suffered or likely will suffer
an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused or will be caused by the defendant, and (iii)
that the injury likely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief.” Id. at 380 (citing

Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) and Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504

U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992)); accord New York Ctr. for Foreign Pol’y Affs. v. U.S. Dep’t of State,

Civil Action No. 20-3847 (PLF), 2024 WL 3400122, at *3 (D.D.C. July 12, 2024). Ifa plaintiff
cannot demonstrate all three requirements for standing, the Court must dismiss the plaintiff's

lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. Hoffman v. Jeffords, 175 F. Supp. 2d 49, 53 (D.D.C. 2001),

aff'd, No. 02-5006, 2002 WL 1364311 (D.C. Cir. May 6, 2002); see Warth v. Seldin, 422

U.S. 490, 502 (1975).

Here, plaintiffs have failed to establish the causation and redressability
requirements of standing as they relate to Attorney General Merrick Garland. See Zakeri v.
Blinken, Civil Action No. 23-3162 (TJK), 2024 WL 3273418, at *3 (D.D.C. July 2, 2024). As to
the causation requirement, the plaintiffs fail to “allege any involvement of. . . the Attorney

General . . . with respect to his and his family’s visa applications.” Siddiqui v. Blinken, 646 F.

Supp. 3d 69, 75 (D.D.C. 2022). As to the redressability requirement, the plaintiffs fail to allege
that the Attorney General has the authority to redress plaintiffs’ injury by ordering the consular
officer to re-open and re-adjudicate the visa applications. Judges in this District routinely

dismiss claims against the Attorney General in actions involving challenges to the adjudication

of visas. See, e.g., Zakeri v. Blinken, 2024 WL 3273418, at *3; Siddiqui v. Blinken, 646 F.

11
Supp. 3d at 75; Liu v. Garland, Civil Action No. 23-1914 (RBW), 2024 WL 3924564, at *4

(D.D.C. Aug. 23, 2024); Nusrat v. Blinken, Civil Action No. 21-2801 (TJK), 2022 WL 4103860,

at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 8, 2022); Kahbasi v. Blinken, Civil Action No. 23-1667 (LLA), 2024

WL 3202222, at *4 (D.D.C. June 27, 2024); Rostamnia v. Blinken, Civil Action No. 23-1638

(RDM), 2024 WL 1328462, at *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 28, 2024).

Plaintiffs’ only justification for bringing claims against the Attorney General is
that “the Attorney General has overarching authority related to immigration enforcement and
policy,” including “the power to review and interpret immigration laws.” Opp. at 5. This
general argument, however, fails to provide “any connection between [the Attorney General’s]
implementation of the [the immigration laws]” and the injuries alleged in this case. Kahbasi v.

Blinken, 2024 WL 3202222, at *4; see Rostamnia v. Blinken, 2024 WL 1328462, at *4.

Plaintiffs’ claims against Attorney General Garland therefore must be dismissed

for lack of standing.

B. The Secretary of State is Not a Proper Defendant
The complaint must also be dismissed against the Secretary of State for lack of
standing. The Immigration and Nationality Act “grants consular officers ‘exclusive authority to
review applications for visas, precluding even the Secretary of State from controlling their

determinations.’” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 1020, 1024 (D.C. Cir. 2021)

(quoting Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); see 8 U.S.C.

§ 1104(a) (excluding from the Secretary of State’s power and duties those “conferred upon the
consular officers relating to the granting or refusal of visas”). The grant of authority to the
consular officer in making visa determinations has led many courts to dismiss similar actions

against the Secretary of State — both because the Secretary of State does not have a role in the

12
adjudication of individual visa applications and because the Secretary of State cannot overturn a

consular officer’s particular determination. See, e.g., Munyaneza v. Blinken, Civil Action
No. 21-2778 (TSC), 2022 WL 4598629, at *2 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2022) (“[N]either the Secretary

of State nor the Acting Legal Adviser, who had no role in adjudicating [plaintiff's] application,

are properly named as defendants.”); Siddiqui v. Blinken, 646 F. Supp. 3d at 75 (“Because only
the consular offices, and not the Department of State, can grant [plaintiffs’] visa applications,
and because [plaintiff] does not challenge any policy or regulation of the Department, [plaintiff]
cannot show that his injury is redressable by the Department of State officials.”); Emad v. U.S.
Dep’t of State, Civil Action No. 23-1789 (TJK), 2024 WL 3509485, at *2 (D.D.C. July 23, 2024)

(same); Kahbasi v. Blinken, 2024 WL 3202222, at *4; cf. Rostamnia v. Blinken, 2024

WL 1328462, at *4 (“[A]lthough the Secretary of State has no legal authority to control which
visa applications consular officers grant or deny, nothing precludes him from directing the
consular officers to decide pending applications ‘within a reasonable time,’ as the APA
requires.”’).

Plaintiffs make two arguments in response. First, plaintiffs argue that their claims
“are challenging policy and regulations issued by the U.S. Dept. of State and that the decision of
the consular officer to deny Mr. Pimental’s [sic] immigrant visa application does not follow the
Foreign Affairs Manual and the INA.” Opp. at 5. Plaintiffs’ argument conflates two separate
issues: the first relates to policies and regulations of the Department of State and the second
relates to the consular officer’s compliance with those policies and regulations. The latter issue
does not implicate the Secretary of State inasmuch as — and as discussed above — he has “no role

in adjudicating [plaintiffs] application.” Munyaneza v. Blinken, 2022 WL 4598629, at *2. As

for plaintiffs’ purported challenges to the “policy and regulations issued by the U.S. Dept. of

13
State,” the Court agrees with defendants that “[t]he Complaint includes no such challenge.”
Reply at 2. In their complaint, plaintiffs cite to two regulations: (1) the “90-day rule,” Compl.
q{ 99-104; and (2) “a new policy that changed the calculation of how unlawful presence time is
accrued for foreign students and exchange visitors.” Id. 4121. In both instances, however,
plaintiffs do not challenge the validity of the policies themselves but instead the application of
those policies by the consular officer in the context of Mr. Pimentel’s application. For example,
in regard to the “90-day rule,” plaintiffs allege that the consular officer incorrectly applied the
change in policy “retroactively” as “the rule that the U.S. consular officer applied in this case[]
only went into effect after September 1, 2017.” Compl. 102. In relation to “the calculation of
how unlawful presence time is accrued,” plaintiffs similarly allege that the consular officer
“failed to follow regulations when [she] was applying a law that was enjoin in that moment.” Id.
at 28 (capitalization omitted). Because plaintiffs allege only the misapplication by the consular
officer of the two policies and regulations rather than the validity of the policies and regulations
promulgated by the Department of State, plaintiffs have not “alleged sufficient involvement by

the [Secretary of State] to allow the case to continue against [him].” Kahbasi v. Blinken, 2024

WL 3202222, at *4; Siddiqui v. Blinken, 646 F. Supp. 3d at 75 (dismissing case against

Secretary of State where plaintiff did “not challenge any policy or regulation of the
Department”).

Plaintiffs’ second argument is that the Secretary of State, in fact, plays a role in
visa adjudications because he “oversees” consular officers and can “issue regulations and
guidance that consular officers must follow.” Opp. at 6. As discussed above, however, plaintiffs
do not challenge the validity of any particular “regulations and guidance” that caused the

consular officer to deny Mr. Pimentel’s visa application. The argument thus fails to sufficiently

14
allege that the Secretary of State “caused” plaintiffs’ injury. See FDA v. Alliance for

Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 378.

Plaintiffs’ claims against the Secretary of State Antony Blinken therefore must be

dismissed for lack of standing.

C. Consular Nonreviewability Doctrine
Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims against the remaining defendant, the U.S.
Consul General in Rio de Janeiro, Jacqueline Ward, must be dismissed because the consular
officer’s decision to deny Mr. Pimentel’s visa is unreviewable under the consular
nonreviewability doctrine. See Mem. at 8. The Court agrees.
“Consular nonreviewability shields a consular official’s decision to issue or

withhold a visa from judicial review, at least unless Congress says otherwise.” Baan Rao Thai

Restaurant v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1024. “The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) does not

authorize judicial review of a consular officer’s denial of a visa; thus, as a rule, the federal courts

cannot review those decisions.” Dep’t of State v. Munoz, 602 U.S. 899, 908 (2024); accord

Rahman v. Blinken, Civil Action No. 23-3235 (JDB), 2024 WL 4332603, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept. 27,

2024). There are only two narrow exceptions to the doctrine: (1) “an American citizen can
challenge the exclusion of a noncitizen if it burdens the citizen’s constitutional rights;” and (2) a
challenge can proceed “if a statute expressly authorizes judicial review of consular officers’

actions.” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1024-25 (cleaned up); see Colindres v.

U.S. Dep’t of State, 71 F.4th 1018, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2716 (2024);

Kolesnikov v. Blinken, Civil Action No. 23-1675 (TSC), 2024 WL 3638345, at *2 (D.D.C.

Aug. 2, 2024). In the event a plaintiff's claim falls within one of the exceptions, a court conducts

a limited review into “whether the Executive gave a ‘facially legitimate and bona fide reason’ for

15
denying the visa.” Dep’t of State v. Munoz, 602 U.S. at 908 (quoting Kerry v. Din, 576 U.S. 86,

103-04 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)); see Colindres v. U.S. Dep't of State, 575

F. Supp. 3d 121, 131 (D.D.C. 2021) (discussing “limited judicial review” if a plaintiff's claim
falls within an exception), aff'd, 71 F.4th 1018 (D.C. Cir. 2023). Finally, although there has
been some confusion in the district courts on the issue, the D.C. Circuit has directed that a
dismissal on grounds of consular nonreviewability does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction;
and dismissal, when appropriate, is based on failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1028-29

(citing Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 682 (2018)).

Plaintiffs argue that their APA and constitutional claims fall within the exceptions
to the consular nonreviewability doctrine. First, they argue that their APA claims fall within the
second exception because the APA “expressly authorizes judicial review of consular officers’

actions.” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1025 (citation and alterations omitted);

see Opp. at 8-9. Second, plaintiffs maintains that their constitutional claims fall within the first
exception to the consular nonreviewability doctrine for claims brought by “American citizen[s]”
challenging a consular officer’s decision that “burdens the citizen’s constitutional rights.” Baan

Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1024; see Opp. at 10-14.

The Court addresses each of'these arguments in turn.

1. APA Claims
Plaintiffs’ argument that the APA authorizes judicial review of a consular
officer’s visa application determination must be rejected. “[T]he D.C. Circuit has squarely held

that the APA provides no basis for challenging consular decisions.” Carter v. U.S. Dep't of

Homeland Sec., Civil Action No. 21-0422 (RCL), 2021 WL 6062655, at *5 (D.D.C. Dec. 22,

16
2021) (citing Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); see Karimova

v. Abate, Civil Action No. 23-5178, 2024 WL 3517852, at *6 (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2024) (“[T]his
court has already held that the Administrative Procedure Act’s general applicability ‘runs
aground’ when it comes to consular visa decisions.”). This is the case regardless of whether “it
is alleged that the consular officer failed to follow regulations,” “the applicant challenges the
validity of the regulations on which the decision was based,” or “the decision is alleged to have

been based on a factual or legal error.” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, Civil Action

No. 19-0058 (ESH), 2019 WL 3413415, at *2 (D.D.C. July 29, 2019), aff'd, 985 F.3d 1020
(D.C. Cir. 2021).

Plaintiffs’ two arguments in opposition to this conclusion are unavailing. First,
plaintiffs argue that the APA permits judicial review of a consular officer decision because
review under the APA “will not be cut off unless there is a persuasive reason to believe that such
was the purpose of Congress.” Opp. at 9. In other words, plaintiffs maintain, judicial review
under the APA is presumed unless evidence suggests Congress intended to limit such review.

This argument was squarely rejected by the D.C. Circuit in Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, in which

the court reasoned that “[w]hen it comes to matters touching on national security or foreign
affairs — and visa determinations are such matters — the presumption of review ‘runs aground.””

Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d at 1162 (quoting Dep’t of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,

527 (1988)). The D.C. Circuit went on to hold that because the presumption “is the opposite of
what the APA normally supposes,” “there may be no judicial review of the decisions to exclude

aliens unless Congress has ‘expressly authorized’ this.” Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d

at 1162; see Doshi v. Blinken, Civil Action No. 23-3613 (RC), 2024 WL 3509486, at *5 (D.D.C.

July 22, 2024) (“Although there is a presumption of judicial review under the APA, the Court

17
observed that ‘the statutory scheme and the nature of the administrative action’ along with the
‘well-established’ ‘non-reviewability of alien exclusion determinations’ precludes APA

review.”) (quoting Bautista-Rosario v. Mnuchin, 568 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6-7 (D.D.C. 2021)). As

discussed above, the APA contains no such express authorization to review consular officers’

decisions. See Carter v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2021 WL 6062655, at *5.

Second, plaintiffs argue that judicial review is appropriate under the APA because
the consular officer did “not follow the Foreign Affairs Manual or immigration regulations.”
Opp. at 9.° This argument, however, does not provide any insight into whether the APA

“expressly authorizes judicial of review of consular officers’ actions,” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v.

Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1025; and claims “that the consular officer failed to follow regulations” are

barred by the consular nonreviewability doctrine. See Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 2019

WL 3413415, at *2.

Plaintiffs’ APA claims therefore do not fall within the second exception to the

consular nonreviewability doctrine for challenges brought pursuant to a statute “expressly

e Among other alleged violations, plaintiffs argue that the consular officer did “not
follow the Foreign Affairs Manual or immigration regulations” when the officer denied Mr.
Pimentel the opportunity to file an “I-601A provisional waiver.” Compl. ff 105, 131. As
defendants point out, see Mem. at 13, Mr. Pimentel is not eligible for the applicable waivers.
The waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) — related to material misstatements in his visa
application — provides that the Attorney General may, in certain circumstances, “waive the
application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(C) in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse,
son, or daughter of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence... .” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(i)(1). The waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)@(M —
related to Mr. Pimentel’s accrual of unlawful days present in the United States — is only available
if an individual is “a [Violence Against Women Act] self-petitioner.” 8 U.S.C.

§ 1182(a)(9)(C)(iii). Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts suggesting Mr. Pimentel was eligible
for either waiver.

authoriz[ing] judicial review of consular officers’ actions.” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985

F.3d at 1024-25 (cleaned up).’

2. Constitutional Claims
Plaintiffs argue that the constitutional claims brought by the Pimentels and
Nelson’s Cabinetry fall within the exception to the consular nonreviewability doctrine for claims
brought by “American citizen[s]” challenging “the exclusion of a noncitizen” that “burdens the

citizen’s constitutional rights.” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1024. The Court

addresses the Pimentels’ and Nelson’s Cabinetry’s claims separately.

a. The Pimentels’ Claims Do Not Fall Within the Exception

The Court easily concludes that the Pimentels’ constitutional claims do not fall
within the first exception to the consular nonreviewability doctrine for claims brought by
“American citizen[s]” challenging “the exclusion of a noncitizen” that “burdens the citizen’s

constitutional rights.” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d at 1024. The exception the

Pimentels seek to invoke “plainly does not apply” because they are not citizens. Albrecht v.
Blinken, Civil Action No. 22-1318 (APM), 2023 WL 4488282, at *2 (D.D.C. June 16, 2023),
aff'd, No. 23-5157, 2024 WL 85917 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 8, 2024). Indeed, the Supreme Court

recently made clear that noncitizens “cannot invoke [this] exception” because they have no

7 Plaintiffs briefly argue that 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is a basis for judicial review. See
Opp. at 9. Defendants correctly point out that, at least as it relates to the claims brought against
the consular officer, defendants are not challenging the Court’s jurisdiction; rather, they seek
dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim. See Reply at 4. Furthermore, any
argument by plaintiffs that 28 U.S.C. § 1331 separately provides a basis for judicial review over
the consular officer’s decision must be rejected because “[S]ection 1331 does not in itself create
substantive rights or causes of action ....” Mead Corp. v. United States, 490 F. Supp. 405, 407
(D.D.C. 1980); accord Stanley v. Duff, Civil Action No. 18-1746 (TSC), 2020 WL 13967974,
at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 4, 2020).

19
“constitutional right of entry to this country as a nonimmigrant or otherwise.” Dep’t of State v.
Munoz, 602 U.S. at 908.

Plaintiffs do not directly address this issue and instead argue that courts have
found that noncitizens who have “previously developed ties to the U.S.” are entitled to certain

constitutional protections. See Opp. 10-11; Bautista-Rosario v. Mnuchin, 568 F. Supp. 3d 1,7

(D.D.C. 2021) (“Fifth Amendment protections do attach when aliens have come within the
territory of the United States and developed substantial connections with this country.”) (citation
and internal quotation marks omitted). This observation, however, does not alter the Court’s
conclusion both because (1) plaintiffs have not identified any constitutional right outside of a

right of entry to this country — which clearly does not exist, see Dep't of State v. Munoz, 602

U.S. at 908 — and (2) because any other constitutional right that may serve a basis for their claim
does not change the fact that the Pimentels are not “American citizen[s]” challenging a decision

that “burdens the citizen’s constitutional rights.” Baan Rao Thai Rest. v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d

at 1024.

The Court therefore concludes that the constitutional claims brought by the
Pimentels do not fall within the exception to the consular nonreviewability doctrine. See Dep’t

of State v. Munoz, 602 U.S. at 908 (“Thus, so far as [the noncitizen plaintiff] is concerned, the

doctrine of consular nonreviewability applies.”); Rahman v. Blinken, 2024 WL 4332603, at *6;

Albrecht v. Blinken, 2023 WL 4488282, at *2 (finding constitutional exception “plainly does not

apply” where plaintiff was a noncitizen), aff'd, No. 23-5157, 2024 WL 85917 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 8,

2024); Cevallos v. U.S. Dep’t of State, Civil Action No. 22-2602 (JDB), 2023 WL 6276622,

at *7 (D.D.C. Sept. 26, 2023) (finding exception does not apply where plaintiff failed to identify

a constitutional right), dismissed, No. 23-5269, 2024 WL 1222050 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 20, 2024);

20
Smirnov v. Clinton, 806 F. Supp. 2d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2011) (“Courts have determined that there is

no property right in an immigrant visa.”), aff'd, 487 F. App’x 582 (D.C. Cir. 2012).

b. Nelson’s Cabinetry Fails to State a Constitutional Claim

Nelson’s Cabinetry — unlike the Pimentels — is not categorically excluded from
invoking the exception to the consular nonreviewability doctrine. The due process claim brought
by Nelson’s Cabinetry, however, suffers from a different problem — namely, Nelson Cabinetry
fails to state a constitutional claim. See Opp. at 12. While plaintiffs are not entirely clear as to
whether Nelson’s Cabinetry is alleging a substantive or procedural due process claim, the
complaint fails to state a claim under either theory.

The Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause protects individuals from deprivations

of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “The due

process guarantee has both procedural and substantive components.” Jacinto-Castanon de

Nolasco v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 319 F. Supp. 3d 491, 499 (D.D.C. 2018). To

state a substantive due process claim, a plaintiff must allege a “violation of a fundamental right

‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history.”” Mahmood v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Civil
Action No. 21-1262 (RC), 2021 WL 5998385, at *9 (D.D.C. Dec. 20, 2021) (quoting Hamal v.

U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Civil Action No. 19-2534 (RC), 2020 WL 2934954, at *4 n.3

(D.D.C. June 3, 2020)). To state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must allege “that an
official deprived him ‘of a liberty or property interest without providing appropriate procedural

protections.’” Azeez v. Murphy, Civil Action No. 23-1947 (CRC), 2024 WL 3924565, at *6

(D.D.C. Aug. 23, 2024) (quoting Atherton v. D.C. Off. of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 689 (D.C.

Cir. 2009)). “Under either theory, a plaintiff must allege [he or] she ‘has been deprived of a

fundamental right or liberty or property interest.” Akrayi v. United States Dep't of State, Civil

21
Action No. 22-1289 (CRC), 2023 WL 2424600, at *6 (D.D.C. Mar. 9, 2023) (quoting Meyou v.

U.S. Dep’t of State, Civil Action No. 21-2806 (JDB), 2022 WL 1556344, at *5 (D.D.C. May 17,

2022)); Bailey v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Civil Action No. 24-1219 (PLF), 2024 WL 3219207,

at *11 (D.D.C. June 28, 2024) (“Before assessing what process was due, the Court must first
determine whether constitutional safeguards apply at all, i.e., whether a private party has a
property or liberty interest that triggers Fifth Amendment due process protection.”) (citation and
quotation marks omitted).

With respect to substantive due process, Nelson’s Cabinetry fails to identify a
fundamental right or liberty interest that is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”

Dep’t of State v. Munoz, 602 U.S. at 910. Plaintiffs argue that the consular officer’s decision to

deny Mr. Pimentel’s visa implicates Nelson’s Cabinetry’s “interest in hiring foreign workers
when there are no qualified available U.S. workers for specific positions.” Opp. at 13. Plaintiffs
do not cite to any authority recognizing this purported right and otherwise fail to provide analysis
as to why the Court should recognize such a right. The only case law plaintiffs provide in
support of this purported right involves — by plaintiffs’ own admission — “a person’s right to
obtain gainful employment,” not an employer’s right to hire foreign workers. Id.; see, ¢.g.,

McNary v, Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 491 (1991); Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41

(1915) (“It requires no argument to show that the right to work for a living in the common
occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity
that it was the purpose of the Amendment to secure”). Indeed, the few courts to consider

Nelson’s Cabinetry’s purported right have found it does not exist. See Spencer Enterprises, Inc.

v. United States, 229 F. Supp. 2d 1025, 1043 (E.D. Cal. 2001) (“The corporation . . . has no

constitutionally protected ‘property interest’ to have an alien admitted into the United States for

22
business purposes.”), aff'd, 345 F.3d 683 (9th Cir. 2003); Commonwealth Utilities Corp. v.

Johnson, 245 F. Supp. 3d 1239, 1259 (D. N. Mar. I. 2017).

On the other hand, defendants provide significant support for their contention that
there is no fundamental right to hire foreign workers. For example, defendants identify
numerous current and historic immigration laws limiting the number of foreign workers allowed
to enter the United States, which strongly suggest that plaintiffs’ purported right is not “deeply
rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” See Mem. at 13-14. Defendants also highlight the
Supreme Court’s recent conclusion that the “through line of history” recognizes “the
Government’s sovereign authority to set the terms governing the admission and exclusion of

noncitizens.” Dep't of State v. Munoz, 602 U.S. at 911-12. Because plaintiffs do not point to a

“subsidiary tradition that curbs this authority” and because the Court must exercise “the utmost
care” when identifying fundamental rights, id. at 910, 912, the Court concludes that Nelson’s
Cabinetry has not identified a fundamental right and has therefore failed to state a substantive
due process claim.

To the extent that Nelson’s Cabinetry seeks to bring a procedural due process
claim, the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Munoz forecloses its ability to do so. In Munoz,

the Supreme Court considered whether a plaintiff — an American citizen — could state a due

process claim after her noncitizen spouse’s visa application was denied. Dep’t of State v.
Munoz, 602 U.S. at 902-03. The Court held that citizens do not “have procedural due process
rights in the visa proceedings of others.” Id. at 917 (“[The citizen-spouse] has suffered harm
from the denial of [the noncitizen spouse’s] visa application, but that harm does not give her a
constitutional right to participate in his consular process.”). In analyzing whether a third party

has a “procedural due process right in someone else’s legal proceeding,” the majority observed

23
that recognizing such a right “would have unsettling collateral consequences.” Id. at 916
(emphasis in original). In particular, the majority reasoned that these claims “would usher in a
new strain of constitutional law, for the Constitution does not ordinarily prevent the government
from taking actions that ‘indirectly or incidentally’ burden a citizen’s legal rights.” Id. at 917

(quoting Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 767 (2005)).

Plaintiffs’ only response to Munoz is that the Supreme Court’s reasoning was
subject-matter specific — that is, the holding is limited to circumstances where “visa denials

impact[] spouses of U.S. citizens.” Opp. at 14. The Court does not read Munoz so narrowly. As

the analysis discussed above indicates, the Munoz majority was concemed with the

constitutional challenges that would flow from recognizing “a procedural due process right in

someone else’s legal proceeding.” Dep’t of State v. Munoz, 602 U.S. at 916 (emphasis omitted).
As the Supreme Court made clear, the “bottom line” is that its case law “does not hold that a
citizen’s independent constitutional right .. . gives that citizen a procedural due process right to
a ‘facially legitimate and bona fide reason’ for why someone else’s visa was denied.” Id. at 919.
Because plaintiffs’ arguments were rejected by the Supreme Court in Munoz, the Court must
dismiss Nelson’s Cabinetry’s procedural due process claim.
* * *
In sum, the plaintiffs’ APA claims must be dismissed because they do not fall

under any of the exceptions to the consular nonreviewability doctrine. See Colindres v. U.S.

Dep’t of State, 575 F. Supp. 3d at 140 (finding it “unnecessary to analyze whether [plaintiff]’s
visa application was denied on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason or any
allegation of bad faith” where plaintiff failed to show his claims fell within an exception to the

consular nonreviewability doctrine). With respect to the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, the

24
Pimentels’ due process claim is similarly barred by the consular nonreviewability doctrine, and

Nelson’s Cabinetry fails to state a due process claim. The complaint therefore must be dismissed

in its entirety.

D. Plaintiffs’ Request to Amend Their Complaint

Plaintiffs request that the Court grant them leave to amend the complaint in the
event the Court grants defendants’ motion to dismiss. See Opp at 16. Plaintiffs allude to two
potential amendments, failing to specify the exact nature of the amendments and how such
amendments would resolve the issues raised in the motion to dismiss. First, plaintiffs suggest
that they could amend the complaint to “remove Defendants that are alleged to be improper.”
Opp. at 16. Such an amendment, however, would not change the Court’s conclusion that the
claims are barred by the consular nonreviewability doctrine. Second, plaintiffs state vaguely that
they can remove a plaintiff if “either Plaintiff cannot seek judicial review under the doctrine of
consular nonreviewability.” Opp. at 16. While it is not entirely clear what plaintiffs mean by
this, removing plaintiffs from this action will similarly not resolve the issues with respect to the
consular nonreviewability doctrine.

In any event, “the local rules in this district require that any motion for leave to
file an amended pleading be accompanied by an original of the proposed pleading as amended.”

Carter v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2021 WL 6062655, at *6 (citing LCvR 7(i) and

LCvR 15.1). The requirement is not a “mere formality,” Kim v. United States, 840 F. Supp. 2d

180, 190 (D.D.C. 2012), aff'd, 707 F.3d 335 (D.C. Cir. 2013), and exists to determine whether

granting leave to amend is in the interest of justice. Carter v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2021

WL 6062655, at *6. Because courts are not “in a position to determine whether or not [the]

proposed amendments would be futile” absent the submission of a proposed amended pleading,

25
“the D.C. Circuit has held that the failure to ‘tender a proposed amended complaint . . . vitiate/s]
any need for the district court to explain why permitting amendment . . . [is] not in the interest of

justice.” Carter v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2021 WL 6062655, at *6 (quoting Kowal v.

MCI Commen’s Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). Plaintiffs’ informal request to

amend the complaint therefore must be denied. See Lucas v. D.C., 214 F. Supp. 3d 1, 7
(D.D.C. 2016) (denying leave to amend where plaintiff failed to include a copy of the proposed
amended complaint with the motion). The request is denied without prejudice in the event

plaintiffs have plausible claims to assert.

IV. CONCLUSION
Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The complaint is dismissed as to
defendants Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Attorney General Merrick Garland under
Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and as to U.S. Consul General, Rio De
Janeiro, Jacqueline Ward under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

An Order consistent with this Opinion will issue this same day.
